# Deployment

Velora supports **local demo** (seed data) and **production** (onboarding only). See [GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md](./GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md) before production cutover.

**Architecture authority:** [MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](./MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md). Migration net state: [MIGRATION_AUDIT.md](./MIGRATION_AUDIT.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Scope | Description |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Public | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Public | Supabase anon key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Server only | Service role for admin user provisioning |
| `VELORA_COOKIE_SECRET` | Yes (prod) | Server only | HMAC secret for device, cashier, tracking tokens, and `sf_active_store` cookies (32+ chars). **Required in production** — app fails closed; never falls back to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (R9 / ADR-002). Legacy alias `SweetFlow_COOKIE_SECRET` still accepted (dual-read). **Must be distinct per environment** (local ≠ staging ≠ production). Sharing secrets across Preview/Production on Vercel is an ops defect — rotate if values match. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Yes (prod) | Public | Canonical **platform** host (auth redirects, invite links, white-label fallback). Distinct per env domain. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_APP_ID` | No | Public | Meta/Facebook App ID for `fb:app_id` on share previews (Sharing Debugger). Create at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/). |
| `PLATFORM_RESERVED_HOSTS` | No | Server only | Extra hostnames that cannot be claimed as org custom domains. |
| `PLATFORM_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS` | No | Server only | Comma-separated emails bootstrapped into `platform_admins` on first authenticated `/platform` access. **Active after S02.** Use distinct lists per env — never share staging ↔ production. |
| `ONBOARDING_REQUIRE_INVITE` | No | Server only | When `true`, forces invite-gated onboarding even outside `NODE_ENV=production` (useful for staging-like local). **Ignored as a bypass:** production always requires an invite — there is no env flag that opens onboarding in prod. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Yes (prod mail) | Server only | Resend API key for transactional email (password reset, invites, session/discount owner alerts). When unset, sends are skipped and core flows continue. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Yes (prod mail) | Server only | Verified Resend from address, e.g. `Velora <noreply@yourdomain.com>`. Domain must be verified in Resend. |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED` | Optional | Server only | Set to `false` to temporarily skip all outbound email without removing Resend credentials. Defaults to enabled. |
| `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` | No | Server only | Optional reply-to address for outbound mail. |

### Resend / transactional email

1. Create a Resend account and verify your sending domain.
2. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` on the host (distinct per env).
3. Password reset uses Supabase Admin `generateLink` (recovery) + Resend template — do not rely on Supabase built-in SMTP for app copy.
4. Manual checks after deploy: `/forgot-password`, create user in Settings → Users, platform company invite, close a POS session, manager discount override.

### Secrets isolation (staging ≠ production)

Confirm before go-live (S16-T4):

1. `VELORA_COOKIE_SECRET` — unique random value per env; 32+ characters; never committed; never reuse service role key. (Legacy `SweetFlow_COOKIE_SECRET` dual-read OK during transition.)
2. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / project URL / anon key — each env points at its **own** Supabase project (MASTER_ARCHITECTURE §15).
3. `PLATFORM_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS` — distinct allow-lists; production list is tight.
4. Vercel: if a variable shows on both Production and Preview, **verify the decrypted values differ** (same slot name does not guarantee distinct values). Rotate Preview independently if needed.
5. Local `.env.local` must not be copied wholesale into production.

**S16 confirmation (2026-07-13):** Guidance above matches code (`signed-cookie*.ts`, online tracking HMAC) and `.env.example`. Host should list `VELORA_COOKIE_SECRET` (and/or legacy alias) on Production + Preview — operator must still prove values are distinct before M6 exit (not verified by decrypting in CI). Brand unify: [BRAND_UNIFY.md](./BRAND_UNIFY.md).

Copy from `.env.example` and fill values in your host (Vercel, Docker, etc.).

### Platform console (`/platform`)

1. Create a Supabase Auth user for each bootstrap email (password or invite).
2. Set `PLATFORM_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS` (comma-separated, distinct per env).
3. Sign in → `/platform` (platform-only users land there automatically; tenant users open the URL).
4. Suspend/reactivate orgs, create company invites (copy token once), review `platform_audit_logs`.

Tenant owners without a `platform_admins` row (and not in bootstrap emails) see AccessDenied.

### Custom domains (white-label)

See [CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md](./CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md). After migration `20260808010000_org_custom_domains.sql`:

1. Platform → org → set hostname → customer DNS (CNAME) + Vercel Domains + Supabase Auth Redirect URLs.
2. Verify in Platform until status is `active`.
3. Staging smoke: login + `/menu` on the custom host; suspended org must show unavailable page.

### Invite-gated onboarding (production)

1. Platform admin creates an invite in `/platform` and copies the **one-time** token.
2. Owner opens `/onboarding` (or `/onboarding?invite=<token>`) and pastes the token.
3. Bootstrap validates the token (pending, not expired, not reused), creates the org, then marks the invite `accepted` with `accepted_org_id`.
4. Reuse / expired / revoked tokens fail with clear Arabic errors.

**Production:** invite required (`NODE_ENV=production`).  
**Local demo escape hatch:** without `ONBOARDING_REQUIRE_INVITE`, local/dev onboarding may omit the token so `db:reset-demo` + `/onboarding` still work. This must never be enabled as a production bypass.  
**Headless** `scripts/bootstrap-org.mjs` remains an ops-only empty-DB tool (service role); prefer `/onboarding` + invite for real tenants.

## Database migrations

Apply **all** files under `supabase/migrations/` in lexical/version order (`supabase db push` / `db reset`). Do not stop at a hand-picked “through 038” list — later timestamped migrations are required.

### Notable migration facts (net state)

| Area | Migrations | Net state after full train |
|------|------------|----------------------------|
| Souqna (`030`, `031`) | Created then **dropped** by `20260612193243_cafeflow_legacy_cleanup.sql` (ADR-009) | **Not live** — do not treat as production Souqna |
| Platform console (`039`) | Created then **dropped** by the same cleanup (ADR-001); **restored** by `20260713133943_restore_platform_admin_console.sql` | Tables **present**; `/platform` UI live after S02 (bootstrap via `PLATFORM_BOOTSTRAP_EMAILS`) |
| Online menu / orders | Dropped in cleanup; **restored** by `20260618*` rebuild migrations | **Present** (first-party QR / online orders) |
| Monthly closing | Dropped in cleanup | **Not live** |

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <your-ref>
supabase db push
```

**Production:** do not run `seed.sql`. Use `/onboarding` with a platform invite token after deploy.

**Local demo:**

```bash
npm run db:reset-demo   # migrations + seed + auth users
npm run dev
```

## Vercel (example)

1. Import repository and set framework preset to Next.js.
2. Add environment variables from the table above.
3. Set build command: `npm run build` (or `npm run smoke:check` in a pre-deploy hook).
4. Deploy; open `/onboarding` with a valid platform invite (or `/onboarding?invite=<token>`).
5. In Supabase → Authentication → URL configuration, add:
   - Site URL: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Redirect URLs: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`, `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback?next=/reset-password`

## Release verification

```bash
npm run smoke:check
```

Manual QA: [SMOKE_TEST.md](./SMOKE_TEST.md)

## Headless bootstrap (optional)

For automation without the UI wizard (requires service role and empty database):

```bash
node scripts/bootstrap-org.mjs --email owner@example.com --password '...' --org "My Shop" --store "Main"
```

The onboarding wizard remains the recommended path for owners.

## npm scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run db:reset` | Supabase db reset (migrations + seed.sql) |
| `npm run db:reset-demo` | Reset + seed auth users (local demo) |
| `npm run db:seed-auth` | Link seed users to Supabase Auth |
| `npm run smoke:check` | Lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, migration/env sanity |

## Backups & PITR restore drill (runbook)

**Authority:** MASTER_ARCHITECTURE §15 — Production Supabase project uses Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) where the plan includes it; document and rehearse restore before pilot trust. No third-party monitoring SaaS is required for this gate — Vercel/Supabase logs are enough for Phase-3 ops awareness.

### Preconditions

- [ ] Production (and staging) Supabase projects identified; prod has **PITR** or daily backups enabled per plan.
- [ ] Service role and cookie secrets for the **restore target** are available to the drill operator only.
- [ ] Drill uses a **throwaway restore project / branch**, never overwrite live prod without an approved window.

### Quarterly restore drill (document results)

1. **Snapshot time:** Pick a known PITR timestamp (e.g. “yesterday 18:00 UTC after closing”).
2. **Restore:** In Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups / PITR → restore to a new project (or preview branch). Wait until healthy.
3. **Point app:** Temporarily point a **non-prod** Vercel preview (or local `.env`) at the restored project URL + anon/service keys. Do **not** change production env during the drill.
4. **Smoke against restore:**
   - Owner sign-in works.
   - Settings → Organization loads.
   - One read of orders/sessions for the restored day.
   - Confirm row counts / a known order id roughly match expectations from the source project at that timestamp.
5. **Secrets:** Confirm restored DB does not inherit wrong cookie secret assumptions — app cookies are host-side; only Supabase data is restored.
6. **Tear down:** Delete the restore project / branch after the drill form is filed.
7. **Record:** Date, operator, source project, restore target, PITR timestamp, pass/fail, time-to-recover, issues.

### Failure criteria

- Cannot restore within the SLA agreed with the owner (default goal: identify + restore read-check within one business day for pilot).
- Critical tables empty or migrations mismatched vs expected schema → stop; escalate; do not promote.

### Monitoring (minimal)

- Vercel deployment / runtime logs for 5xx spikes.
- Supabase logs for auth and Postgres errors.
- Error budget notes live in existing ops docs when present (`ERROR_BUDGET` if used) — **do not invent** a SaaS product for M6.

**S16 (2026-07-13):** Drill procedure written. Actual PITR restore **not executed** in this session (no approved restore window). Leave go-live checkbox unchecked until first drill is signed.
